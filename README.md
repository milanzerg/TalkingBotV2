_The Creator:_

## Tech

**TalkingBot** uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [Telebot] - python library for Telegram-API
- [Sklearn] - python library for AI and machine learning

And of course **TalkingBot** itself is open source with a [public repository][TBV2]
 on **GitHub**.
